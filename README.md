# Brushless motor driver

A library to demonstrate space vector modulation (SVM) using three center aligned PWMs. Using alternating reversing sequencing. For more informations on SVM 
see these [slides](http://www.kappaiq.com/download/presentation-material/PDF/05%20Modulation.pdf).

Here you can see the sequencing for a slow rotating vector with magnitude 0.8.
